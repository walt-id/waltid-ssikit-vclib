# Project Sunset: waltid-ssikit-vclib

## Introduction

We would like to inform you that the VC-Lib has been officially sunsetted and is no longer supported. We have replaced it with our new and improved offering, [Custom Credential Templates](https://docs.walt.id/v/ssikit/concepts/credential-templates) directly available in the SSI-Kit. We have made this transition to provide our users with a more efficient, feature-rich, and seamless experience. We appreciate your support and understanding throughout this process.

## What does this mean for you?
As the VC-Lib has been sunsetted, we will no longer be providing updates, bug fixes, or customer support for it. We encourage you to transition to the [Custom Credential Templates](https://docs.walt.id/v/ssikit/concepts/credential-templates), as soon as possible to continue receiving the best possible service and support. The new version offers several benefits, including:

- It is direcly integrated into the SSI-Kit
- It offers great flexibility when it comes to default and dynamic data
